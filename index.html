            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>I am a 3rd year undergraduate with major in Artificial intelligence, having a deep interest in brainstorming and solving problems technically. This interest has taken me to pursue a bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence.
                I'm also having a good knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 as a development language and C, C++ and python as programming ones. I've solved dozens of programming questions over different online judges which have increased my problem solving and critical thinking capabilities many folds.</p>
